Hello! This is the Movie on Rails web application!

This is a site that will allow you to create an account as a movie critic. You can see a list of all movies (A-Z) or select one based on its genre. If you are allowed administrative privileges, you may also add new movies, add new actors, and change the administrative status of other critics.

Contributors guide: for any changes, please reach out directly to Emily Howard (howard.emilya@gmail.com)

To get everything set up, please bundle install.
